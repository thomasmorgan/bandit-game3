    <hr>

    <p>Across this experiment you will complete <span class="rounds"> rounds, each of which involves <span class="trials"> trials.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the early trials in each round you may be able to "check" the food sources.</p>
    <p>If you choose to check, you won't earn any points on that trial, but you will get to see how many points each food source would have been worth.</p>
    <p>Checking can help you learn how temperature affects how many points each food source is worth, but remember it will not necessarily be possible to check.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Within each round the two food sources are always the same, however between rounds they might change.</p>
    <p>If one or both of the options do change you will have to learn how temperature affects the new options.</p>
