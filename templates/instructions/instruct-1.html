    <p>In this experiment you will earn points by choosing how to find food.</p>
    <p>On each trial you will choose between two food sources. For instance, you might choose between picking berries or hunting fish.</p>

    <img src="../static/images/fish.png">
    <p>Different food sources are worth different amounts of points and the more points you get the bigger your bonus payment will be.</p>
    <p>When you choose a food source, you will earn points, but you will not be told how many you earned.</p>
    <p>However, on some trials you may be able to "check" the food sources. If you check, you won't earn any points on that trial, instead you will see how many points both of the food sources would have been worth.</p>
